Problem Statement: 
Travelling on roads on this country is a nightmare for people with visual disabilities, Make the navigation process easier for the visually impaired driverless vehicles and drones. Reducing road accidents by detecting moving and stationary objects.

Our Idea: 
We are posing a solution where we are using ultrasonic waves to its full potentioal. The proposed technique uses an ultrasonic sensor which detect obstacles by emitting sound waves at a frequency too high for humans to hear. They then wait for the sound to be reflected, calculating distance based on the time required.

Generally Cameras, millimeter wave radar, LiDAR and other sensors are widely used in the obstacle detection of driverless vehicle. However, cameras  are highly dependent on the environment and greatly affected by external factors, especially in the process of high-speed driving, which is easy to produce serious system errors, and even unable to detect obstacles. Use of infrared can fail in cases like like  inability to use them in sunlight due to interference. It can make outdoor applications or dark indoor applications difficult.  Lidar is efficient but too costly to implement so we used ultrasonic sensor. 

Outcomes of Our Implementation: 

1. Implementation of the idea on Visusally Impaired: 
For visually impaired person, we will use the ultrasonic sensor and that will be in the form of jewellery which will be hanged in the neck like a locket where the chain will be wirelessly connected with an earpiece/ tws, etc  which will be automated and will be explaining about the surroundings or an alarm indicating there is an object.

2. Implementation for driverless cars:
For Car, ultrasonic sensor would be positioned at the front and the tail of the car for detecting potholes with which if there is obstacle at front of the car the LCD displays front side and if the car is approaching near It would display back side and alarm or buzzer can also ring indicating an obstacle.
